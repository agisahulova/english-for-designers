Hello, I'm Agi and i want you to tell you my story.
All of us know the feeling when the head says something, but the heart says something different. We feel confused and we don't know what to do next. Should i listen to my head or my heart?

## Past

When I was a child, my family and I would often go on holiday. I used to fly with grandma and grandpa, too. It was a great adventure. I've always looked forward to being by the sea. There was one other thing I was really looking forward to. And that's when I walk into the airport and then the plane. I've always felt like I'm on another planet. It was an incredible experience for me. 
Over time, I found the airport more and more appealing. I felt elated and adrenalineful when I heard the sound of airplanes. I liked the beeping at the airport when they broke the news about the flights. My parents once took me to a view point at the airport, where I saw planes landing and leaving. We were there a long time because I didn't want to go. Since then, I can't even count the number of times I've been on the view. Often when I wanted to be alone, my direction was clear. View. I once wondered what it would be like to work at an airport and be so close to everything. I have developed a strong bond to this place.
When I was in 5th grade, I got my camera for the first time, and I forgot about the airport. I enjoyed the photo shoot very much and wanted to be a photographer. I took pictures of friends, nature, animals. I went to high school about photography and then college. I've always wanted to have my own studio. The photo shoot was fine, but I didn't feel so good about it. Even so, I kept going. In my head, I was like, I'm not sure a photo shoot is for me. The times went on and on.



## Presence
I'm in college today and my head is full of stress. I only touch the camera because I have to take pictures to school. I don't care about it that much. My thoughts about the airport came back, and suddenly it gave me more energy. I thought- what if I finish school and go work at the airport? Yes, I plan to. I want to keep the photo shoot as a hobby. I'm ready to go to the airport, but I have to do my exams first. Can I finish school? Can I handle a job interview? Of course I do! I'm motivated

## Future
What could my future hold? I hope it's the way I want it to be. My heart would always drag me to the airport and my head would tell me to give it a shot. I know the photo shoot didn't go well and the airport will be the thing. So wish me luck, now I'm waiting for an email with an interview date.

Listen to what your heart tells you. It's the right thing to do.
