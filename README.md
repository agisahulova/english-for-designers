## About

**Hello, my name is Agáta. I'm a Prague-based photographer.** 

I think of myself as friendly, sometimes moody, but happy to help. My natural expression is like *don't talk to me please*, but don't worry because it's not that I'm thinking anything bad.

My dream has always been to become a photographer. I got my hands on a camera for the first time when I was in the 5th grade at elementary school. Since then, the camera has been with me ever since. I have tried to take pictures of many categories in photography, but the closest to me are self-portraits. I like when I can express myself through a photo. And I also like it when it's just me and the camera at a given moment.

What do I do in my spare time? I make people happy because I work as a courier, so I deliver food to people. I have my dog ​​at home, with whom I spend most of my time. I also like to read and watching movies and have been thinking a lot about the future lately. I'm thinking of giving up photography and keeping it as a side job. I am drawn to work at the airport, in an environment with airplanes. I like that I can be so close to people who in a few hours will be somewhere completely different and maybe fulfilling their dream.

## Featured Projects
As I said before, I prefer to take self-portraits, so I will show you a few projects about self-portraits. These projects were created either for me or for the school and I am proud of them.

### Project 1

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

I created this first project in high school when covid started. I wanted to show how I feel in masks and how uncomfortable it is for me. Wherever I was, I had to wear a mask. The reason why I'm naked and only wearing a mask is because it felt like I was still clothed and the mask became normal clothing. I'm glad I have it recorded, because when I'm not feeling well, I remember this time and realize that it could be worse.

### Project 2

These photos were taken when I was in my first year here. This period was mentally challenging for me and it honestly helped me to confide in the camera. In the photos you can see me, sad and tied up. It has always been a problem for me to confide and run away from problems.
It was also difficult for me to show these photos to the public, because I do not confide in people, but in the camera. But I managed it and I was relieved.

### Project 3
Here I have a couple of unrelated photos for example, but I like them.

I took this photo in my favorite spot in the garden. It was just me and the camera enjoying the moment.

This photo was taken during covid when I was locked at home and felt sad and bored so I had to entertain myself

This photo is from a time when I felt a heavy weight on my chest. That was because I had a lot of work to do and couldn't keep up. So instead of what I should have done, I took my camera and went to take pictures instead.
