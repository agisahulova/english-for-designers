Wiriting about JUST world
What does the word just mean to me?
To me it's quite a dangerous word and a bit ironic too.
The first thing that comes to mind when the word can be used is in a relationship.
An exact example is when a boy says "she's just a friend". It then breaks out into an argument.
Or it happens when I'm in a bad mood but I keep it to myself.
My friend asks me what's wrong and I say nothing. But after a while I will say "just". 
Because I realize that I actually want to say how I feel or what's going on.
Furthermore, the word just is actually another word meaning boundary.
If we want to allow the child to watch TV, we say that he can watch, but only for an hour. 
It's a limiting word that everyone uses these days.
I think it is necessary to be able to use this word. It can often be taken as a word that turns the whole conversation upside down.
I personally find this word horrifying even though I use it. 
It also occurs to me that someone takes the word just lightly.
I say to myself - I just wanted to help. I'm just a cleaner and not a manager. 
I find that a bit of an understatement.
